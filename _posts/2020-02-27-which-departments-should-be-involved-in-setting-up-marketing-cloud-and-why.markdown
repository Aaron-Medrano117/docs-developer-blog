When you’re implementing a new technology — especially a wide-reaching marketing automation platform like Salesforce Marketing Cloud — it’s easy to get wrapped up in the small details and forget about the bigger picture.
If you’re ready to implement Marketing Cloud, you need to identify the departments that should be involved in the transition phase. You should also ensure that you have well-developed processes in place that will allow you to make the most of your new marketing automation platform. Read on to discover which departments you should involve in your Marketing Cloud implementation in order to ensure success.
Marketing and Sales
While your sales and marketing departments may operate independently and seem like two disparate operations, they work towards a shared goal. Their processes have key similarities that make marketing automation technology useful to both teams. Quite simply, these departments should be heavily involved in the implementation process because the platform will have a positive impact on both teams.
There is growing evidence that automation is effective at generating and nurturing leads for both marketing and sales departments. Automation has been shown to increase the conversion rate from marketing response to qualified marketing lead by 53%, and lead to a 9.3 percent higher sales quota achievement rate.
Marketing Cloud can also help each department with their daily workflows — from managing daily tasks and networking, to creating and maintaining clear and effective reports. Involving both departments in setting up Marketing Cloud allows them to give input on how to customize the software for their needs.
Service
The team who takes care of servicing your clients is uniquely poised to help set up Marketing Cloud. Because this team keeps client needs front and center, they can provide key insights into the features that are likely to work well for your existing and potential clients. Marketing Cloud will also help your service team to analyze and track client preferences, as well as to create targeted campaigns based on that information later down the line. This means you need to work with these employees to ensure that your technology is set up effectively.
Using their experience solving problems, your service team will be able to provide feedback from the outset on how to customize the technology to better serve clients. For example, your service team might know that a lot of clients ask a specific question after buying your product or moving forward with one of your services. By working together during the implementation of Marketing Cloud, you can set up the automation capabilities to preemptively send clients an email with the answer to that question.
Similarly, if your service team knows that many clients complain about the quantity or content of emails they’re receiving from your company, you can adjust your email strategy within Marketing Cloud. This information is valuable to have as you implement your new technology, as you’ll be able to set it up exactly as your company intends to use it.
Your service team is also a great asset for testing the capabilities of your Marketing Cloud solution from a client perspective. Set up a process for regularly checking in with these team members as you move through the implementation phase. Ask them to review and test aspects of your new technology and your proposed uses for it.
IT
While this depends on the amount of data you want to bring into Marketing Cloud, IT is often involved in implementing Marketing Cloud. IT helps ensure your MX records are set up so you can send from your domain, that the password policies are consistent with your company’s policy and your internal IP is whitelisted (so you do not have to continually get verification codes). By building a stronger partnership with your IT organization they can help ensure the right data is connected so you can leverage it for triggered sends, personalization, and segmentation. It is important to not overlook how data and getting the right data in can ensure you are sending hyper-personalized emails and working towards your goals.
Leadership
It should go without saying that your leadership team has a critical role to play in setting up any new technology, and Marketing Cloud is no exception. If there are any perceived gaps between those on the top floor and those on the ground floor, this will prevent effective communication and limit the reach of your new technology.
Start by identifying one or two leaders within the company who can spearhead the implementation of Marketing Cloud. These leaders can be made responsible for communicating the implementation plan to all employees, providing updates as your company moves through the setup process, and ensuring that everyone understands the benefits that will come from using Marketing Cloud.
Engaging leadership as you set up Marketing Cloud keeps your company on track with its mandate and branding. Your leadership team is perfectly positioned to see the bigger picture and help all your different departments work together toward the common goal — successfully implementing a new technology that can drive transformative value at your business. Ultimately, input from your leadership team will help to cement the efforts of your sales, marketing, and service teams.
