A Fanatical Experience Means a Win for Customers - A Support Perspective

Working in technical support comes with its own unique set of challenges and opportunities, but it also means that we get the satisfaction of remaining at the forefront of technical change as things move so rapidly, and new hosting services and products change seemingly quicker than a new iPhone can be released.  
Because of this, Rackspace’s refreshed Core Values are a breath of fresh air as they have been simplified through not merely offering the Fanatical Support that the company is known for, but by targeting the entire customer journey, from the very first contact with Rackspace, to create a **Fanatical Experience** for customers.

*** Excellence
We’re an accountable, disciplined, high-performing company with proven results.
Obviously, in support especially, if a company is not able to provide a level of excellence in its products and services, it becomes an uphill battle to differentiate itself from other businesses.  
Rackspace holds strong to its original promise of providing an experience in which it is expected of not only customers to hold Rackers accountable for the best quality outputs possible, but for Rackers to continuously push each other to be great.  We are there to help each other and lift each other up, and assure that the support we are providing is second to none.  
In a day where customers have unprecedented access to forums, rating site, and social media, if a company does not live up to a high level of excellence, customers are able to make sure their voices are heard, both with their wallets as well as their commentary.

*** Customer-driven
We’re proactive, collaborative, and committed to success for our customers
In Support, we often work with other teams in a collaborative effort to assure that a customer has the best experience possible.  
Sales might speak with support, whom speaks to the account team, who speaks to billing, in a harmonious dance behind the scenes.  To us, it is not only important to solve issues as they pop up, but to keep headaches from ever happening in the first place and with as minimal an impact on customers as there can be.  By being as proactive as possible, we are driven to the success of our customers, sometimes without them even knowing.

*** Expertise
We’re passionate learners, rooted in our customer’s business to provide unbiased solutions.
One of the top strengths that we see most often in support is **learner**.  Because of this, there is never a shortage of Rackers learning the newest technologies to assure that we remain at the front of technological advancements to assure a quality product that is able to have an amazing level of knowledge behind it to help its support.  
Because we love learning, we are always open to other Racker ideas as there are various perspectives and ways to view problems.  
This allows us to grow technically and professionally and thus provide a higher level of expertise for customers to provide a Fanatical experience.

*** Agility
We’re adopting new technologies and evolving services to meet customers where they are in their journey
Couple with our drive to learn mentioned above, agility is paramount in the technology space as I have often taken a few days vacation only to come back to multiple process changes and application updates.  We are driven to learn new technologies to not fall behind in providing quality support to customers.  
If a Racker is unable to remain agile, then so too would his ability to provide excellent customer service, which is not an option on the support floor.  That being said, Rackers help each other to be great as there is not a mentality of dog-eat-dog here at the Rack.  
We very much understand that no one person knows it all and that the only way to win is by banding together to help each other succeed.

*** Compassion
We’re one team doing the right thing for our customers, communities, and each other.
Sure we give back through donations to charities, both in money and time, but the compassion piece of the Core Values puzzle is so very much more.  We used to have an ideology of treating fellow Rackers like friends and family, but understood that we left out a group that is just as important to Rackspace: customers.  
We are here for our customers, and only through providing great service and products to them do we get to live in this symbiotic relationship.  And through our gains from providing a Fanatical Experience, we are empowered to give back to the community.

While the new Core Values are focused on a the customer experience, at the heart of that is the support that we hope to continue to provide to customers, both internal and external, and the goal of Rackspace still remains the same.  Our goal is to provide the type of experience that customers deserve in each and every interaction with Rackspace: a Fanatical Experience.
