As the world leader in CRM software, Salesforce knows the value of a well-trained team that understands the importance of customer data. That’s why there are 25 certifications available to nurture Salesforce talent. Salesforce designed each course, divided into its own certification track, to meet the growing demand for technical skills.

When it comes to showing off your technical abilities, a Salesforce certification packs a punch. Whether you’re an application architect in the making or you’re a business leader hoping to train a team of cloud consultants, Salesforce certifications help you develop and differentiate yourself in the market. With over 100 learning resources and hours of education to explore, you can make sure that you’re all set to get certified.
