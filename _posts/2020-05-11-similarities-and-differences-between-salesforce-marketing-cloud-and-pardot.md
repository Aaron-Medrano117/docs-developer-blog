Editor’s Note&mdash;Chris Zullo recently presented at London’s Calling and Southeast Dreamin’ with fellow Salesforce&reg; MVP
Stephanie Foerst on the differences between Salesforce Marketing Cloud and Pardot. We asked him to share his
thoughts on these dueling Marketing Automation tools. You can watch a recording of their
original presentation at London’s Calling [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFAUujdORkU&feature=youtu.be).

Which Salesforce marketing automation platform is right for your business:
Pardot or Marketing Cloud? This is a great question, and the answer isn’t always immediately clear. Most of our clients already
understand the importance of using marketing automation to connect their sales and marketing efforts. Pardot and Marketing Cloud
can both help, depending on your marketing automation goals.

While both Pardot and Marketing Cloud are marketing automation solutions, Pardot is a tool, while Marketing Cloud is a toolkit.
The latter offers clients more options when it comes to B2B and B2C marketing&mdash;however, this doesn’t necessarily make it your best choice.
This depends on what you are trying to achieve with your marketing efforts.

To help you decide which is right for your company, the following is a breakdown of some common uses for marketing automation,
and the differences between Pardot and Marketing Cloud.

### Creating email campaigns

Email is not a new marketing innovation, but it remains the most valuable one. Email marketing has the [highest ROI](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-new-rules/)
of any marketing channel and both Pardot and Marketing Cloud enable you to create custom email campaigns.

If you’ve ever created an email campaign using an email service provider, you’re likely familiar with drag-and-drop templates
and WYSIWYG text editors. Pardot and Marketing Cloud work in a similar way, and simplify email creation. You don’t need to know HTML or another
coding language to use either tool, but like any email editor, knowing some can be useful when making custom tweaks.

Previewing your email campaign is one major difference between Pardot and Marketing Cloud. Marketing Cloud allows users
to toggle between a live desktop or mobile preview while designing their campaigns. Pardot, on the other hand, needs rendering time, and uses
Litmus to let you preview your email on Outlook, different mobile devices, and more.

When sending emails, Pardot and Marketing Cloud both let you customize options like sender’s name, and create subject lines
based on dynamic content such as the location of a lead. Marketing Cloud offers more flexibility, and you can use any content
in Salesforce to customize and create targeted subject lines.

### Landing pages

Landing pages are key to helping you capture the information you need to pull a lead down your marketing funnel.

Both Pardot and Marketing Cloud let you start from scratch or create a landing page using
an existing template &mdash;although Pardot offers less template choices. Landing pages built in Marketing
Cloud are mobile optimized, while in Pardot you have to build and maintain it with your own CSS styling to optimize it for mobile.

The publishing process is also different. With Marketing Cloud, you can save and launch your landing page at a future date.
This is perfect if you’re not ready to open registrations, publish your white paper, or capture other information. Pardot doesn’t
offer this option&mdash;but it does let you hide your landing page from search engines until you’re ready to go public.

### Social Sharing

Pardot and Marketing Cloud both allow for some level of social sharing through their tool. Options are
limited in Pardot to basic posts on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, while Marketing Cloud uses its Social
Studio tool to listen, engage, and publish updates across any platforms. Once again, it depends on what you need&mdash;
Pardot can be used as a social media updater, while Marketing Cloud’s Social Studio is an all-in-one social media manager.

### Best practices

Pardot and Marketing Cloud are most helpful when you follow a few best practices.

Keep your database clean. This is especially true for Pardot,
which charges clients [based on the number of prospects](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=pardot_admin_database_limit.htm&type=0)
in the database&mdash;upgrades are made in batches of 10,000 prospects.

Finally, remember that marketing automation tools are meant to help, not take over. Neither
Pardot nor Marketing Cloud is a tool you can set and forget. Marketing automation can make your life easier,
but that doesn't mean you should start duplicating email campaigns or using the same messaging across email, social,
and mobile. Marketing best practices still apply, and tools like Pardot and Marketing Cloud are meant to complement your other marketing efforts&mdash;not replace them.

There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to marketing automation tools, and you should choose the tool that helps you achieve your goals.
