Salesforce has long been a leader when it comes to industry developments. One of the latest, most promising
innovations is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to oversee business interactions — something 85% of
people are expected to use by 2020. With its reputation for being ahead of the curve, it came as no surprise
when Salesforce released Einstein, its AI platform, in 2016; the tool has been growing more robust ever since.

As a Market President at RelationEdge, I’ve had the privilege of getting up close and personal with Salesforce
and its many integrations, including Einstein. The Einstein AI technology goes beyond helping just a single
company department; the tool can add value across an entire business and its lead-to-loyalty cycle.

Here’s a look at how it can help at each stage along the way.

### Marketing: Personalize Messaging & Targeting

Marketing is all about personalization, and Einstein is quick to learn which product bundles and item
recommendations are most likely to coax your lead from a casual window-shopper to a customer. Large companies
such as Netflix and Amazon already use AI to provide customers with recommendations and suggested product systems.

AI-driven personalization has worked for Salesforce customer Icebreaker, a New Zealand-based company that crafts
clothing from merino wool. By using Einstein Product Recommendations and creating personalized search category pages,
Icebreaker learned that customers clicked these recommendations 40% more often, leading to an 11% overall increase in average order value.

### Sales: Gauge Prospect Sentiment & Score Leads

Gauging the sentiment of customers and prospects is one of the essential tasks of a sales team member. When talking with dozens
of prospective customers, prioritizing positive leads and sales questions can be a challenge. We’re all mired with incredible amounts of
data, but we’re lacking true information; with Einstein, the important insights rise to the top.

Einstein Sentiment analyzes a short snippet of text — an email reply or sales inquiry, for example — and classifies the exchange as
positive, negative, or neutral. It then prioritizes sales messages in a faster and more knowledgeable way. The software continues
learning as it analyzes more text samples, consistently becoming better at classifying the sentiment of a given text snippet.

Einstein also uses predictive lead scoring to rank whether leads are likely to convert — by looking at factors such as past deals
and your historical sales data — so your sales team knows where to best direct their efforts. As time goes on, Einstein continually
improves its predictions, finding new insights in your latest sales data and showing you how those insights were calculated. This
gives your sales team an easy way to sift through mountains of data and prioritize the leads that are most likely to close.

### Fulfillment: Filter Customer Information & Manage Supply

Einstein’s capabilities go beyond just closing the deal with your prospects; this AI tool can also help you delight your
consumers after the deal is won. Once a lead has become a customer, the responsibility passes to your fulfillment team to
deliver on your company’s promise. Whether your offering includes a product, service, or both, your fulfillment team’s challenges
revolve around filtering and organizing a massive amount of customer information and managing supply. Einstein analyzes the status
information of a customer from an order and supply chain perspective. It can then filter those pieces of data appropriately, and
flag data points that are trending the wrong way to sales and customer service. This lets your team prioritize and address fulfillment
issues before they escalate.

Einstein can even assist with supply management. One of the integration’s latest features, Einstein Vision, allows companies to streamline
inventory management. Take, for example, Coca-Cola’s use of Einstein. By uploading a photograph of a display cabinet, the Einstein software
was trained to recognize when the stock of a certain soda was running low. The software could place orders to restock supply based on images,
as opposed to having an employee look at the stock, count it, and manually enter the order into a system.

The same technology could be applied to manufacturing shelves, clothing stores, and more, improving business process and efficiency

### Service: Gauge Customer Sentiment About Your Business

As with the sales stage, the service stage is all about gauging a customer’s sentiment. That’s where Einstein Intent, the complement to Einstein Sentiment,
comes into play.

Einstein Intent allows you to take a longer piece of text document — for example a whole email, or an article of some kind — and pull out certain types of information.
By programming the tool to crawl online review pages or customer feedback emails, your business can easily extract valuable information; such as whether a message is
positive or negative, who is providing that feedback, and other preprogrammed details. Your service team can then use this information to improve customer service in the
long term, without the monotony of going through every single document to gauge customer sentiment.

### Finance: Protect Against Fraud

Einstein can even help in the finance department as an advanced tool for fraud detection. Today, many leading companies and banks are turning to
more robust AI tools — those that use machine learning to constantly adapt and protect a company’s system from the increasingly complex web of online
fraud. Einstein gives small businesses equal access to the fraud protection measures that larger companies pay millions to obtain.

### If You Have Salesforce, You’re Ready to Use Einstein

Einstein’s impressive AI capabilities bring benefits to all departments of your business. The best part is Salesforce customers already
have access to Einstein — all you need to do is enable this integration for your business with your own licensing key. As a full-service
partner, RelationEdge can help you do this by weaving Einstein with your existing business process to ensure you’re getting the most of
your AI technology at every stage of your lead-to-loyalty cycle.
