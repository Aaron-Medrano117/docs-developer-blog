Digital advertising is officially bigger than [traditional advertising](https://www.vox.com/2019/2/20/18232433/digital-advertising-facebook-google-growth-tv-print-emarketer-2019), which means if it has not already started consuming a larger share of your ad spend, it soon will. This also means having technology that effectively pulls in and analyzes your customer data from digital platforms is essential to your advertising success. 

Enter: [Data management platforms](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/05/what-is-a-dmp.html) (DMPs).

[DMPs like Salesforce&reg; Audience Studio (formerly Salesforce DMP)](http://salesforce.vidyard.com/watch/cwaPkdMeYSXEXP9oLF4X5r) are the backbone of data-driven marketing efforts. A DMP collects, organizes, and activates first, second, and third-party audience data from any source&mdash;online, offline, mobile, and beyond. These platforms allow your company to gain unique insights into your customers, as well as effectively segment and reach your audience. 

As a Solution Architect at Rackspace, I help clients install and learn to use tools like Audience Studio every day. This blog introduces Audience Studio and explains how you can use it to maximize your digital advertising efforts.

### How does Salesforce Audience Studio work?

[Salesforce Audience Studio](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/data-management/) is a powerful Marketing Cloud feature. It is a customer data marketplace that can only be acessed by other platform users. Audience Studio can also be paired with [Data Studio](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/data-sharing/), which gives you the chance to sell data and purchase look-alike audiences. 

Audience Studio helps companies offer customers more valuable advertising and media experiences. It is a cloud-based data platform that operates in real time, unifying customer data from all screens and sources into a single view of the individual. This allows you to analyze the data, better understand unique customer preferences, and then activate the data across any delivery channel.

To understand the opportunity and security of using data through Audience Studio, keep the following things in mind:

- **Your company does not have to sell its data.** You can also choose the data you are willing to share. 
- **Data in the marketplace is anonymized.** First-party data with details like customer names cannot be sold or purchased&mdash;only second and third-party layers are available to be shared.
- **It is a closed marketplace.** Only Salesforce Audience Studio customers can purchase data. 

Audience Studio incorporates both a supply-side platform (SSP), to help with ad inventory, and a demand-side platform (DSP), that helps marketers maximize the efficiency of their ads. The diagram below shows how the SSP and DSP come together to fuel the ad exchange process.

Audience Studio can increase the effectiveness of your media spend by ensuring your ads are served to the consumers who are most likely to convert&mdash;but only if you have a plan for using this powerful tool.

### How can you make the most of Salesforce Audience Studio?

Audience Studio is especially effective for [Business-to-Consumer (B2C) companies in the retail industry](https://www.salesforce.com/video/1758211/), but it can also be beneficial to companies in many other industries. 

Audience Studio is available to companies with a large enough ad spend to get a valuable return on investment. If you meet the minimum ad spend, you can start taking advantage of this powerful tool as way to make more impact with your advertising dollars. 

There are a number of things that you should have in place before using Audience Studio. Here are a few of my top recommendations:

### 1. A media plan

It is critical to develop a media plan before working with Audience Studio. This tool provides so much data that it can be easy to get lost if you are not employing a thoughtful approach. A media plan provides a strong foundation for your Audience Studio strategy; it provides a budget, timeframe, and goals to guide your efforts. 

If you need help getting started, check out our blog for resources on creating strategies to boost your social posts, target your audience, supplement your blog efforts, and more. 

### 2. A skilled team with a Data Architect

Audience Studio can be very technical, so it is important that you have a data architect or data scientist on your team. A data professional can help you accurately interpret and identify the data that will make a difference to your digital advertising efforts. If you do not have an in-house data professional, you may want to consider outsourcing this role to a contractor or partner that can help you set your business up for success.

### 3. A full-service implementation partner 

Salesforce Audience Studio employs both the creative and technical sides of marketing. It uses technology and hard data to support your advertising decisions, and also requires knowledge of marketing concepts&mdash;like understanding the customer and their buyerâ€™s journey&mdash;to create an effective strategy. Given the complexity of this platform, it is best to work with a full-service implementation partner.
