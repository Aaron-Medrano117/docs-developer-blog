Your company’s sales team is growing and your books are in the black. While this is good news, with significant growth also comes increased complexity&mdash;if your Configure, Price, Quote (CPQ) process isn’t growing with you, your pain points will soon become evident.

Manually configuring quotes for individual clients will leave your sales team at a disadvantage and cause burn out. It can be difficult or even impossible, to scale your process for quotes without the help of automated software. 

Thankfully, CPQ solutions like Salesforce CPQ & Billing are designed specifically for this purpose.

Salesforce CPQ streamlines your processes and expedites your quote-to-cash cycle&mdash;which is the time between when a customer requests a quote from your company and when they make a payment. CPQ software allows you to integrate with other internal systems so the customer always receives the most comprehensive, accurate quote. 

While this software can make your salespeoples’ jobs much easier, implementing a new technology solution can be intimidating if you do not have a plan. As a Salesforce Platinum Consulting Partner, we have helped implement the use of CPQ software at many businesses; we are familiar with the common roadblocks and how to tackle them. 

Here are six tips for overcoming some of the most common CPQ implementation challenges.

### Using Bad Data

**The Problem:** The data in your CPQ system must be current, accurate, and verifiable. Otherwise, the proposals you provide to customers could include inflated prices or inaccurate delivery times. This is true for manual proposals as well automated CPQ processes.

Imagine that you are running an end-of-the-year product promotion. Without updating your CPQ solution to consider the new prices, your sales team may inadvertently deliver proposals to customers that do not include the promised savings. 

**The Fix:** When setting up your CPQ software, establish a clear process for maintaining accurate data, and hold data owners responsible for keeping their information updated. You may decide product managers should update product details each time a new generation is released and that the marketing or sales team will be responsible for updating promotional pricing. 

###  Integration Woes

**The Problem:** If you fail to integrate your CPQ solution with other essential software, you risk using incomplete or non-current data in these different systems. This can create many problems, including customers receiving misleading contracts or inaccurate customer data being communicated to stakeholders.

**The Fix:** When implementing your CPQ software, consider how your different data systems will communicate with each other. Your CPQ system needs to integrate with your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. It may also need to communicate with your product data management, contract management, or other important systems. 

Choose a CPQ solution that offers either custom or out-of-the box integration. If you are working with an implementation partner, at the start of your project, outline all the important platforms that your CPQ system should communicate with. It can be expensive and time consuming to try to fix a data integration problem&mdash;set yourself up for success at the start. 

### Taking On Too Much At Once

**The Problem:** Big changes to your CPQ process can overwhelm your team. Moving from spreadsheets or manual templates to integrated CPQ software will change the day-to-day workflow. Users may trouble transitioning, resulting in user mistakes or overall resistance to the software. Moving too quickly may end up being a costly mistake that affects long-term adoption of the product. 

**The Fix:** Consider using the Crawl-Walk-Run approach to roll out your new CPQ practices across multiple releases. Much like a business may change its website functionality over the course of several months, you can roll out the functionality of your new CPQ software in sections. Start with the tools that are easy to use and will benefit the most employees; introducing these tools first will help spread positive feedback among your team and encourage optimism about the upcoming changes.

### Not Fully Taking Advantage of Your Software’s Benefits

**The Problem:** You may be hindering your team and leaving revenue on the table if: your CPQ system makes it challenging to customize a quote with an additional service or product, or does not provide reminders about current promotions and new product lines. Some businesses fail to take advantage of the benefits of their CPQ solution&mdash;including reminders to your team about new products or promotions. 

Without reminders, you may have to adjust pricing later-on because your sales team forgot to include an applicable promotion. This can frustrate your customer&mdash;or worse, drive them away.

**The Fix:**  A good automated CPQ system can remind users of all available, relevant add-ons every time they use it. This helps ensure that customers are being offered useful products and services and provides a more consistent customer experience. 

### Not Expecting and Preparing for Human Error

**The Problem:** A myriad of human errors can be introduced into the standard CPQ process. A salesperson could forget to include necessary shipping or delivery costs, or they may omit a product that the installation team will need. Expecting that your sales team will never make a mistake is just not realistic.

**The Fix:** Mitigating errors is everyone’s job. First, your entire team must be trained on a rolling basis and your sales team should understand how your products relate to one another. Next, set up your CPQ solution so that users are alerted when they omit critical information. Finally, institute a review process for necessary situations and identify the chain of command to be alerted when a mistake is made. Note that manual or complex review processes can slow down your quoting process, so keep the number of reviewers to a minimum.

### Losing the Human Element of Communicatio

The Problem: Customers who are used to dealing directly with a salesperson during the quoting process may miss having the opportunity to ask for clarification or pose specific questions. While automating the proposal process means customers have a proposal in their hands faster, sometimes it can seem like a “colder” process to the customer.

Similarly, discussions that may have taken place between departments while developing a quote may decrease after implementing a CPQ solution. Without conscious effort, this may cause teams to become siloed and ultimately cut off communication and the sharing of data.

The Fix: Encourage your sales team to follow up with customers after each proposal is delivered. The goal is for your customers to maintain the ability to access their sales rep as needed and still experience the human side of your business. Every proposal should include ways to get in touch with your brand. To foster internal communication, implement strategies and feedback loops for different teams to check in regularly with each other regarding new accounts, promotional campaigns, and more.
