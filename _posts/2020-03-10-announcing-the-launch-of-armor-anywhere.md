Armor Anywhere is a cloud security platform that delivers threat detection and
response capabilities as well as compliance for applications and data across
all major private and hyperscale public clouds. Because Rackspace manages your
cyber security with Armor Anywhere, defending against attacks and detecting
threats, you are free to focus your time, effort, and valuable resources on the
other technical aspects of your environment, infrastructure, and systems.


Armor Anywhere provides the following benefits:

  business requirements.
