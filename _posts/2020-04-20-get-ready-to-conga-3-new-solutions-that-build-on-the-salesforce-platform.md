Many companies are turning to cloud based applications to increase the return on their Salesforce CRM investment. Last month RelationEdge went onsite with Conga to get a more intimate understanding of their new offerings. We received training on how to quickly navigate Conga’s applications and more efficiently handle customer and prospect requests. Conga’s solutions can help streamline processes and align our clients’ sales, marketing, and customer service strategies.

Conga is best known for their document generation solution. With Conga, a click of a button can generate documents as complicated as a contract with the right clauses for that particular deal, an excel file 100% formatted per management’s expectations, or a simple quote using your Salesforce data. However, they’ve continued to evolve their product suite with the addition of three new solutions: Contracts, Sign, and ActionGrid. All three are strong additions to the Conga suite, and all are aimed to more efficiently organize, simplify and automate data document generation.

### Conga Contracts: Speed Up the Contract Negotiation Process

This may sound familiar: You know that Salesforce helps to streamline daily activities and can increase your sales, but everything is getting bogged down in the contract management lifecycle. Your sales reps have to reach out to legal to make amendments or get approval, a process which can be tedious and time consuming, especially when you are almost at the finish line. Conga Contracts can come to the rescue.

Conga Contracts gives customers the ability to send a contract for negotiation, redline, and compare changes all within Salesforce. Solutions like Conga can help equip your team and speed up the contract negotiation process —  resulting in more closed deals!

### ActionGrid: Actionable Views Into Salesforce Data

Sales reviews their forecasts at the end of each week to make sure management is addressing every deal correctly. Sales operations is charged with creating a very specific output at the end of each call, typically taking them hours or even the entire weekend to make sure the output is correct and formulated correctly.

With ActionGrid, sales operations can quickly change the data in their reports, including mass updates, multi filter, formulas, batch actions, and conditional formatting, even while on a call! Even better, once the data is updated, paired with the power of Conga Composer, sales reps can export each report with a click of a button.
