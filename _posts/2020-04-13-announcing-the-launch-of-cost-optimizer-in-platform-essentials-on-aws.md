Rackspace Fanatical Support for AWS recently launched the enhancement of cost
optimization features in the Platform Essentials service block for North America
region customers.

<!-- more -->

Weâ€™re excited to announce that we are expanding the Platform Essentials with
Cost Optimizer on AWS feature set to the Europe, Middle East, and Asia (EMEA)
region at the end of April. This product enhancement comes from the pre-existing
Optimizer offer from Onica, a recently acquired Rackspace company. Rackspace
chose to acquire Onica partially because of the success of this product.

### Challenges

We hear from our customers all the time about the number of challenges when it
comes to controlling costs in the public cloud.

- **Knowledge and awareness**: AWS offers over 40,000 product SKUs with dozens
of pricing constructs. How can you stay on top of releases and decide what is
best for your company?

- **Ongoing improvements**: A single large negotiation, such as an AWS Enterprise
Discount Program (or EDP), does not ensure savings. How can you make sure you
realize new savings opportunities as your environment changes over time?

- **Business growth and sprawl**: As organizations grow, new business units and
cost centers emerge, all with their own spend and objectives. How can you keep
the organization on track to understand areas of spend and control costs?

We know that as more customers operate in the public cloud, we need to apply
more focus on cost optimization support. By including Cost Optimizer in Platform
Essentials, we guarantee that you receive an optimization focus in our most
basic, required service block.
