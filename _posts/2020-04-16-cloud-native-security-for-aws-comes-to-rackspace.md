Amazon Web Services (AWS) has more Cloud Native Cybersecurity tools available than ever,
but many businesses lack the expertise to quickly analyze and respond to this data. Rackspace
is the first consulting managed security service provider (MSSP) to partner with the AWS Security Hub.
The Rackspace Service Blocks for Cloud Native Security (CNS) integrates directly with the AWS Security Hub,
pulling threat information and alerts into your AWS environment.

Certified security experts in the global Rackspace Security Operations Center (SOC)
offers you around-the-clock managed security services for 3 AWS security products:

- AWS Security Hub
- Amazon GuardDuty
- IAM Access Analyzer

### Amazon GuardDuty

Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that uses machine learning, anomaly detection,
and integrated threat intelligence to collect and aggregate account and network activities to identify
potential threats. Rackspace integrates and configures Amazon GuardDuty for your accounts and continuously
analyzes these findings. Certified security experts help you understand and respond to this information.

### IAM Access Analyzer

The IAM Access Analyzer identifies resource-based policies that would allow external access to your
environment. Rackspace monitors this information, validating any changes, and addressing issues as necessary.

### AWS Security Hub

The AWS Security Hub enables aggregation of findings from member accounts and from other AWS Security services,
like GuardDuty and IAM Access Analyzer. Rackspace provides you full visibility to this information through an
easy to understand interface. Rackspace CNS enables and configures the AWS Security Hub for all your accounts
and regions in scope.
