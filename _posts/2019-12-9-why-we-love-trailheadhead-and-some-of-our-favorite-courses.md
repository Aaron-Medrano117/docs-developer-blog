The Trailhead&reg; training platform offers courses for everyone, from IT
architects and engineers to marketers, to learn Salesforce&reg; in a fun and
engaging way. In fact, it’s so engaging that about 200,000 people used it to
learn how to use Salesforce within Trailhead’s first year of existence.

At Rackspace, we use Trailhead to sharpen our Salesforce skills and ensure that
our technology implementations always deliver transformative business value. But
Trailhead isn’t just a must-use training tool for our team&mdash;it’s
something we all *want* to use.

I asked the Rackspace team why they enjoy developing their Salesforce skills
through Trailhead and which courses they’ve found most helpful for implementing
Salesforce and training end-users on how to navigate it. Read on to find out
which Trailhead courses you should try first, according to our team of experts.

### What makes Trailhead so appealing?

Trailhead makes learning about the many different aspects of Salesforce
technology easy, no matter how much time you have, what role you work in, or
which skill level you’ve reached.

[Over 100 “trails”](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/trails) provide guided
learning paths that develop your Salesforce skills through a series of modules.
Some trails take as little as an hour to complete, while others take a deep dive
into a product or feature for 20 hours or more. Trails are labeled by level
(beginner, intermediate, and advanced) and the type of Salesforce user (business
user, administrator, marketer, or developer), so you can find the right trail for
yourself. If there’s a particular area of Salesforce that you’d like to really
study up on, [trailmixes](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/trailmixes)
feature a collection of relevant trails to give you a comprehensive overview.

“Salesforce has done a fantastic job with Trailhead,” says Megan Truett,
Salesforce Project Manager. Truett has always been impressed by how the mountain
of Salesforce knowledge is broken down into small, consumable chunks, and
this has really helped her learning process. “The practical application at the
end of most modules is the perfect way to ensure that you actually understand
what you just read. Plus, the gamification of the points and being awarded
badges for completing the courses makes for fun motivation.”

Taking the time to go through trails makes a huge difference in using Salesforce
with confidence and skill&mdash;and that doesn’t just go for our team. Clayton
Bruckert, Senior Salesforce Architect, explains that going through
end-user-oriented modules with our clients can really help them to get
comfortable with their new Salesforce technology.
“[Adoption goes more smoothly](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxContentListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000FHCi6UAH),
and clients can manage their instance and discover new features for
themselves.”

### How can you get the most out of Trailhead?

Trailhead makes it easy for any member of an organization to find trails and
learn course content effectively&mdash;you just need to know what you want your
team to focus on. With so many trails and learning modules available, it can be
overwhelming for you and your employees, if you don’t have clear goals for how
to use Salesforce.

The good news is that the extensive Trailhead offerings very likely includes
a module, trail, or trailmix that suits your needs perfectly. There are courses
for everything from
[nonprofits](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/search?keywords=nonprofit) to
[financial service companies](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/search?keywords=financial%20service).
After you’ve honed in on what you and your team should learn about, you can
filter through trails, browse through your options, and start exploring
the Salesforce knowledge you want to build. That’s exactly what we’ve done at
Rackspace.

You can use the [myTrailhead](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/mytrailhead)
feature to facilitate your in-house development and onboarding process. This
part of the Trailhead platform enables you to customize training programs to
your exact needs while providing the same user-friendly, self-paced learning
experience. It opens up new possibilities and takes your
Trailhead usage to the next level.

### Which are our favorite trailhead courses?

Since Trailhead launched at
[Dreamforce 2014](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/tech-pubs/2015/05/trailhead-new-approach-learning-salesforce.html),
we’ve been trying out the different trails, earning badges, and boosting our
technical knowledge across the board. So which courses do we recommend?

Karisa Booth, Head of Service Delivery Marketing Cloud, suggests starting with
the basics&mdash;specifically, with the
[CRM for Lightning Experience](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/lex_implementation_basics)
module. “You need to know what a CRM is and best practices before you can do
any custom automation.”

I created a
[Salesforce Crash Course](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/users/chriswhitehead/trailmixes/salesforce-crash-course)
trailmix for new clients to provide a helpful overview of using Salesforce for
this very reason. I also love the process automation badges. Getting the
superbadges is great, too, because they demonstrate that you can really
configure.

Jeff Richards, Chief of Technical Architecture, also enjoys the superbadges and
recommends the four
[Lightning superbadges](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/search?keywords=lightning%20superbadge).
“You have to go through the associated modules to unlock them&mdash;it’s as close
to a real-life situation as you can get without doing a real-life implementation.”

Chris Zullo, Solutions Sales Leader Marketing Cloud, has a different take.
“If it’s not marketing, it doesn’t matter!” While he might be only partially
kidding, his top pick is still the
[Marketing Cloud Trailmix](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/users/chriszullo/trailmixes/marketing-cloud).
