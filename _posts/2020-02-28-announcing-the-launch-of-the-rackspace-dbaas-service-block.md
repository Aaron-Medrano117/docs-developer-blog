Rackspace is launching production-tested datastores in a simple-to-use and
dependable cloud Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platform, powered by ObjectRocket.

<!-- more -->

Rackspace recently introduced the concept of Service Blocks, which provides you
with a defined, streamlined path to achieve specific data, infrastructure, and
application management and transformation initiatives. We designed Service Blocks
to give you the flexibility to engage with the necessary service and expertise,
without forcing commitments to more than you need. This new model of delivering
services is exceptionally compatible with our ObjectRocket Database-as-a-Service
platform, so we’re proud to launch Rackspace Database-as-a-Service Service Blocks.
Whatever data journey your company is on, Service Blocks provide both the
foundational services that we recommend to build and maintain a robust data
environment and the services to then transform and modernize your data.

### DBaaS Service Block overview

Rackspace DBaaS, powered by ObjectRocket®, takes the burden of database strategy,
planning, management, and administration from your teams so you can focus on
core business objectives. Instead of spending time monitoring database
performance, scaling resources, and troubleshooting issues, you can turn your
team’s attention toward building new capabilities and growing your business.

Rackspace provides fully managed, automated, and highly available products and
services, including MongoDB®, Elasticsearch®, PostgreSQL, Redis®, and CockroachDB,
which our expert DBAs and customer data engineers support. The ObjectRocket
platform provides instant access to production-ready instances with the latest
database technologies, elastic resources to shrink and grow capacity, and
performance based on your application’s needs&mdash;all on a secure platform
monitored and maintained by a team of database experts.

With this service, Rackspace ensures that the database is reliable, scalable,
and fast by helping customers with the entire project&mdash;from critical early
decisions like data replication and modeling to security assessments and
architecture guidance to round-the-clock monitoring and support.

### Focused on solutions

The DBaaS Service Block solves the following significant challenges faced by
enterprise companies today:

- **Planning**: Rackspace continually analyzes the market to select the best
  database technologies for each use case, taking the guesswork out of picking
  a new database technology. Rackspace experts guide you to the right technology
  for your needs.
- **Provisioning and configuration**: Rackspace bases the database configurations
  on industry best practices to keep your data secure and address your performance,
  availability, scalability, and financial requirements.
- **Monitoring and maintenance**: Rackspace handles all database monitoring and
  maintenance so that you can focus on your business. This service includes
  24x7x365 monitoring, upgrades, migrations, and planning for special events.
- **Future-proofing and migration**: Rackspace tells you about new and upcoming
  technologies. When the time comes to add a new feature or technology to your
  data stack, Rackspace helps you to plan and migrate to that new technology.

### Key features and benefits

Database management through a DBaaS platform provides a sought after level of
automation, flexibility, and security to support technologies that experience
increased traffic and fast growth. The ObjectRocket platform differentiates
itself in the industry with 24x7 hands-on human support, best-in-class datastores
offering a complete portfolio to support your application’s use case and needs,
and open source technologies in public clouds to protect customers from vendor
lock-in.

### DBaaS Service Block features

Rackspace removes the administrative complexity of database management so that
customers can focus on driving innovation with the following critical features:

  the data industry to identify the most popular data stores by use case
  including structured, distributed, document store, search and logging, value
  type and caching, and time series.
- **Available at scale**: ObjectRocket designed its platform, a key component
  of the DBaaS service, to elastically scale up and down based on your needs,
  offers built-in failover, and backs it with an industry-leading 99.95%
  platform-uptime guarantee.
- **Fully managed backups**: All instances on the ObjectRocket platform come
  with managed daily backups and two-week retention to help ensure that you
  never lose data.
- **Lightning fast, highly performant**: Rackspace optimizes infrastructure for
  database environments with high performance, low-latency networking, and SSD
  storage.
- **Security best practices**: All products on the ObjectRocket platform follow
  security best practices and include SSL/TLS, IP address whitelisting user
  authentication, and at-rest encryption. The Rackspace management interface
  supports role-based access control and multi-factor authentication.
- **Always-on support**: Rackspace monitors databases around the clock to help
  ensure that the database is active and performing correctly. Our database
  engineers take action whenever possible to avoid potential issues, quickly
  react when problems do arise, and provide regular feedback when changes are
  needed to improve future performance.

### DBaaS Service Block benefits

As a key benefit, the DBaaS Service Block gives your team their time back by
removing the burden of planning, provisioning, administering, and supporting
databases. However, DBaaS provides so many more benefits, including:

- **Production-ready databases in minutes**: Go from signup to a fully functional
  database in minutes. An intuitive interface and efficient API make it easy to
  deploy production-ready database stacks quickly.
- **Smart scalability**: Scale smoothly, rapidly, and safely as the Rackspace
  team of database engineers and administrators applies deep database
  understanding to anticipate your future data needs.
- **Performant platform with global reach**: Experience lightning-fast speed
  with a widely distributed architecture, cloud options, and global data center
  connectivity that gets your data as close to the application as possible.
- **Reliability and expertise**: Take advantage of database experts who are
  available whenever you (or your database) need them. Your team can focus
  exclusively on the business, while Rackspace helps ensure that your data is
  always available.
- **Lower TCO and increased business agility**: Gain economies of scale that
  yield operational savings compared to DIY. The portfolio of datastores,
  combined with a depth of expertise at Rackspace, enables you to consume the
  best-fit technology without massive investment.
