According to Microsoft, SAP requires that all customers migrate to SAP
S/4HANA by 2025, or they lose support. As a result, approximately 10,000
customers need to migrate by 2025.

As customers modernize, an increasing number of SAP users plan to make the move
to public cloud on Azure. Rackspace Application Services for SAP helps companies
streamline operations, reduce costs, and mitigate risks during this migration.
Rackspace offers agile and cost-effective full-service solutions that deliver
proven expertise at scale in managing leading SAP applications on Microsoft Azure.

### What is SAP S/4HANA?

According to [SAP](https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html), "SAP S/4HANA
is an intelligent, integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that
runs on our in-memory database, SAP HANA."

SAP goes on to explain that the product provides intelligent automation,
follows proven best practice for professional services, enables you "to make
better decisions faster with embedded analytics, a conversational interface,
and digital assistants," and "enable new business models as your marketplace
evolves."
