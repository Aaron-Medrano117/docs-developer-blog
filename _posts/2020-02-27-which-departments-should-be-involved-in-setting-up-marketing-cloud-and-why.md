When you’re implementing a new technology&mdash;especially a wide-reaching marketing automation platform like Salesforce
Marketing Cloud&mdash;it’s easy to get wrapped up in the small details and forget about the bigger picture.

If you’re ready to implement Marketing Cloud, you need to identify which departments to involve in the
transition phase. You should also ensure that you have well-developed processes in place that enable you to
make the most of your new marketing automation platform. This blog explains which departments you should involve
in your Marketing Cloud implementation to be successful.

### Marketing and sales

While your sales and marketing departments might operate independently and seem like two disparate operations,
they work towards a shared goal. Their processes have key similarities that make marketing automation technology
useful to both teams. Involving these departments in the implementation process is a good idea
because the platform will have a positive impact on both teams.

There is growing evidence that automation is effective at generating and nurturing leads for both marketing and
sales departments. Automation increases the conversion rate of marketing response to qualified
marketing lead by 53%, and leads to a 9.3 percent higher sales quota achievement rate.
Marketing Cloud can also help each department with their daily workflows&mdash;from managing daily tasks and networking,
to creating and maintaining clear and effective reports. Involving both departments in setting up Marketing Cloud lets them
give input about customizing the software for their needs.

### Service

The team responsible for servicing your clients is uniquely poised to help set up Marketing Cloud. Because this team
understands client needs, they can give insights about the features that are likely to work well for
existing and potential clients. Marketing Cloud also helps your service team analyze and track client preferences,
as well as to create targeted campaigns based on that information. This means you need to work with these
employees to ensure that your technology is effectively set-up.

Using their problem-solving experience, your service team can give immediate feedback about customizing
the technology to better serve clients. For example, your service team might know that a lot of clients have a specific question
after buying your product or using one of your services. By working together during the Marketing Cloud implementation,
you can use automation to preemptively send clients an email with the answer to that question.

Similarly, your service team can tell you if clients have feedback about the emails they’re receiving from your company and help you
adjust your email strategy with Marketing Cloud. This is valuable information for implementing your new technology exactly as your
company intends to use it.

Your service team is also a great asset for testing the capabilities of your Marketing Cloud solution from a client perspective. Set up a
process for regularly checking in with these team members as you move through the implementation phase. Ask them to review and test aspects
of your new technology and your proposed uses for it.

## IT
While this depends on the amount of data you want to bring into Marketing Cloud, IT is often involved in implementing Marketing Cloud.
IT helps ensure your MX records are set up so you can send from your domain, that the password policies are consistent with your company’s
policy and your internal IP is whitelisted (so you do not have to continually get verification codes). By building a stronger partnership with
your IT organization they can help ensure the right data is connected so you can leverage it for triggered sends, personalization, and segmentation.
It is important to not overlook how data and getting the right data in can ensure you are sending hyper-personalized emails and working towards your goals.

### Leadership
Your leadership team plays a critical role in setting up any new technology like Marketing Cloud.
Any gaps in leadership support affects effective communication and limits the reach
of your new technology.

Start by identifying one or two leaders within the company who can spearhead the implementation. These leaders are responsible for
communicating the implementation plan to all employees, providing updates as your company moves through the setup process, and ensuring that everyone understands
the benefits of Marketing Cloud.

Engaging leadership during set-up keeps your company on track with its mandate and branding. Your leadership team is perfectly positioned to
see the bigger picture and help all your different departments work together to successfully implement a new technology that can
drive transformative value at your business. Input from your leadership team helps to cement the efforts of your sales, marketing, and service teams.
