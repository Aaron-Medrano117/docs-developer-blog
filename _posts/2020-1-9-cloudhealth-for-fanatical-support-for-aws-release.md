This blog explores why Rackspace chose CloudHealth and how we’ve taken a customer-focused approach
to integrating and setting up CloudHealth.

### Why CloudHealth?

Controlling cloud costs is a common pain point for public cloud consumers. CloudHealth helps Rackspace
work with our customers to control costs effectively in the following three areas:

– Visibility: Before you can control costs, you have to identify and understand them&mdash;a tall order for
AWS and other cloud providers who have notoriously complex billing. Users across an organization also need
different information. For example, the person in Finance who is choosing between Savings Plans or Reserved
Instances needs different information than the budget owner in Engineering who wants to see an e-mailed
report of trending costs and an actionable view of underutilized resources.  

– Control: Organizations control costs by creating appropriate budgets, having departmental accountability
(including chargeback or showback), and exercising governance (that is, no tag, no play).  

– Savings: Most organizations significantly overspend in the public cloud, with few exceptions. Shining the
light on, and introducing, accountability for spend is a significant first step. CloudHealth also shows you
how to take advantage of discounts like Reserved Instances and Savings Plans and identifies unneeded resources.  

We believe that CloudHealth enables Rackspace, working with our customers, to solve for these three outcomes
better than any other platform. As a bonus, it works across AWS, Azure&reg;, and the Google Compute Platform&reg;.  

### Our Integration and Approach

Rackspace is the first CloudHealth partner to fully integrate with their platform to include everything from
account setup to user management. For example, billing customers can use single sign-on from the Rackspace portal
into CloudHealth. Users have full access to CloudHealth with near real-time cost data, savings opportunities,
inventory, and much more.  

We also recognize that access to powerful tools is a necessary first step to achieving your goals, but it's not
enough on its own. Rackspace adds expertise on top of CloudHealth to help you to set up reporting for
different users. We can configure CloudHealth *Perspectives*, which meaningfully segment spend and other data,
and review costs and savings opportunities with you.  

### Summary

We are proud to provide Rackers and our Fanatical Support for AWS customers with CloudHealth to help with
complex challenges around visibility, control, and cloud spend savings. Our ultimate goal is to work closely
with you to achieve meaningful outcomes.
