Information Design and Development Presents RPC-O v13.1!

<!-- more -->

At Rackspace, we have an Information Design and Development team that consists
of 17 information developers/editors that partner with all Rackers and external
contributors to create content for internal and external use. We are currently
engaged with our Cloud offerings, Dedicated Hosting, internal tools/portals,
the customer-facing
[How-To article collection](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/),
the [OpenStack Innovation Center](https://osic.org/),
and the third-party cloud upstream platforms that we support, including
[Amazon Web Services](https://www.rackspace.com/managed-aws) and
[VMware](https://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/vmware).

Most recently, the team worked alongside the Rackspace Private Cloud Powered By
OpenStack (RPC-O) offering team and delivered the 13.1 release, which reflects
the upstream
[Mitaka](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/mitaka/) release
of OpenStack-Ansible.

RPC-O is the Rackspace-productized version of upstream
[OpenStack-Ansible](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/).
RPC-O uses OpenStack-Ansible to deploy the private cloud, and also includes several
Rackspace-specific Ansible playbooks that can assist with deploying monitoring,
logging, support specific tooling, and database backups.

Weâ€™d like to invite you to read and use all the Rackspace content, and to
contribute enhancements or corrections to the published deliverables!  All of
our content is available in public github repositories, so feel free to open an
issue or submit a pull request.  We have an
[on-demand mini-course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haFooDkKr-A&feature=youtu.be)
that outlines the process.
