Change can be daunting, even when you know you’re moving toward a better solution. 
As a Salesforce administrator, you probably know that it’s in your organization’s 
best interest to make the leap from Salesforce Classic to Lightning. The challenge is &mdash; how can you sell this critical step to your superiors and to your team at large? 

As you work on developing the perfect pitch, incorporate these top five reasons for transitioning to Salesforce Lightning.


#### Greater productivity

In mid-2018, Salesforce released a [Forrester Consulting study](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/total-economic-impact-study-on-salesforce-lightning-shows-341-percent-return-on-investment-over-three-years-300661371.html) that showcased one of the greatest benefits of moving to the Lightning experience: enhanced productivity. The study found that the combination of a newer interface and forward-thinking tools, such as Salesforce Einstein, make it easier for users to accelerate existing processes. 

In fact, [the study revealed](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/total-economic-impact-study-on-salesforce-lightning-shows-341-percent-return-on-investment-over-three-years-300661371.html) that in IT departments that have transitioned to Lightning, measurable productivity has increased “by up to 25 percent and [has cut] time-to-market for applications nearly in half.”

#### Saved time and dollars

Along with significant jumps in work productivity, the Forrester study also showcased Lightning’s ability to trim costs and save valuable working hours. Over the course of the 3-year economic impact study, it was shown that Salesforce Lightning can save “end users in sales organizations more than an hour a week in productivity.” Moreover, because there is significantly less turnover in developer roles, some organizations saved more than $165,000 in hiring costs alone.

#### Third party integrations and customizations

The Salesforce Lightning framework makes it easier than ever for developers to create modern Salesforce apps. As a result of this advancement, integration to various third party apps becomes much more accessible for administrators and developers alike.

With Lightning, it’s also possible to add custom components to the interface. These customization options create an improved opportunity for personalization that didn’t previously exist in Salesforce Classic.

#### Modernized user interface

The updated look and feel of Salesforce Lightning makes it a user favorite. New UI features were designed with key business teams in mind, as Salesforce created an [intuitive and smart-thinking platform](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/spring16/release-notes/rn_lex.htm) that “helps sales reps work more naturally and close more deals faster.” 

What’s so special about the interface changes? Even at a first glance, you’ll notice things like easier-to-read text, icons, and graphics that provide a better and clearer overall business snapshot. Updated dashboards give you improved visibility into the metrics that matter most to your role, so you can grasp the big picture for your teams and customers. 

Ultimately, the convenience and ease of a streamlined interface makes it easier to foster user adoption of your platform.

#### Certainty for the future

Simply put, Salesforce Lightning is the way of the future. There’s a great deal of uncertainty about how long [interface support for Salesforce Classic](https://tech.co/crm-software/salesforce-lightning-vs-classic-compared) will be available to users. In order to avoid the risk of having your organization be automatically rolled over to Lightning at an unexpected time, be proactive now and make a planned switch to Lightning to avoid future hurdles.
