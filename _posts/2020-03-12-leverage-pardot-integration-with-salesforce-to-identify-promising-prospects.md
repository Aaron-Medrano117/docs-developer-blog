Marketing automation systems such as Pardot form an essential element for the
productivity of marketing and sales teams. Pardot is a business-to-business (B2B) marketing
automation platform that Salesforce&reg; offers to help sales and marketing teams
work together more effectively by leveraging intelligence about a prospective
customer’s level of engagement.

Pardot includes a variety of automation tools, including drip campaigns where
marketing teams can send a programmed series of emails to prospects and leads.
Tracking a prospect’s response to the drip campaign enables you to identify engagement
and areas of interest. Pardot enables you to create a variety of message types, including invitations for upcoming events or webinars.

Pardot also includes tools that enable you to create landing pages for events,
registration, and other activities. By using these tools, your organization builds
a prospect profile that you can access and manage through Pardot and within Salesforce.

When you build a customer base, you should focus on prospective customer engagement
because this indicates where in marketing and sales you should focus your efforts.

Track the following items to evaluate customer engagement:

- Do the prospects open your emails or view your newsletters?
- Do they visit your **Contact Us** and pricing pages?

Tracking customer engagement enables you to identify the most promising prospects
on which to focus your time and energy.



When you combine the power of Pardot’s prospect profiling with Salesforce automation,
you become even more effective. For example, when a lead’s score hits a certain point
based on their email and web activity, automation can trigger a workflow to notify a
salesperson. This powerful tool helps your sales team spend their time on the most
qualified leads.
