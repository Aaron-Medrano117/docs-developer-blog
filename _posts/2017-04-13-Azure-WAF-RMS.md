Azure SQL is Microsoft's answer to Platform as a Service for SQL Server. It extracts a lot of the day to day administrative tasks of managing an installation. Letâ€™s take a look how a consumer of Azure SQL can export data to restore to a local on-premise installation.

Most SQL Server users are familiar with the concept of doing a backup using SQL Server Management Studio resulting in a backup (.bak) file. With Azure SQL, backup files are not supported, but instead BACPAC files are generated. A BACPAC file contains the database schema and data. If you want to generate a BACPAC file, you can use the Azure portal, but that becomes tedious when you are doing a lot of exports each day on random databases. After doing a few exports using the portal, I decided to write up a PowerShell script with prompts to choose a DB and export to a storage container.

Clone or download my repo [Here](https://github.com/jrudley/export-AzureSqlDb) to grab the PowerShell script that lets you download Azure SQL BACPAC files. Assuming you have [Azure PowerShell](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/) installed, you can pass in some parameters to omit certain prompts or just run it and answer the prompts. If you run the command **.\Export-AzureSqlDB.ps1 -statusBar**, it will prompt for the following:



The script will export out the BACPAC uri which you can download the BACPAC file
