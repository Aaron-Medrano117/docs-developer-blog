Rackspace is proud to announce the general availability of Rackspace Government
Cloud (RGC) on Amazon&reg; Web Services (AWS).

Rackspace offers this solution as a direct result of both validated customer
demand and observation of changing technology dynamics. RGC on AWS brings an
already best-in-class managed security and compliance platform to the public
cloud, which enables state-of-the-art private, public and hybrid cloud solutions
for the government ecosystem. System integrators (SIs) and independent software
vendors (ISVs) that leverage our platform can significantly shorten the time and
cost required to achieve Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)
Authorization to Operate (ATO). A FedRAMP ATO often yields a cost savings of up
to 70% when compared to hiring hourly consultants.

You can layer the Rackspace managed services and security offering on top of the
Rackspace Government Solutions (RGS) private cloud or AWS, to help provide
reliable uptime and performance for government services. Rackspace monitors your
managed environments every hour of every day. This comprehensive transparency
into the status of your infrastructure enables you to evaluate and identify risk
and to prevent issues before they arise.

Rackspace alleviates the customer burden of the following concerns:

- log consolidation
- OS licensing and administration
- patching
- vulnerability scanning
- backups.

We operate, manage, monitor, and control the security components of your
environment from the physical facilities to the host OS and virtualization layer.
We also handle approximately 80% of the operational and documentation burden of
the security and compliance requirements within the environment to help you
receive a FedRAMP ATO.

Rackspace remains a leader in the FedRAMP authorization enablement space,
powering 13 FedRAMP ATOs built on the Rackspace managed service, and provides
24x7x365 hybrid-cloud management, operational support, and security services as
a packaged, on-demand, audited, and pay-as-you-go service.
