Many companies are turning to cloud-based applications to increase the return on their Salesforce&reg; Customer Relationship Management (CRM) investment. Rackspace recently went onsite with [Conga] (https://conga.com) to get a more intimate understanding of their new offerings. Conga provided training on how to navigate their applications and more efficiently handle customer and prospect requests. Conga’s solutions can help streamline processes and align clients’ sales, marketing, and customer service strategies.

Conga is best known for their document generation solution. With Conga, you can create complicated documents like contracts, well-formatted excel files, or simple quotes from your Salesforce data. However, they’ve continued to evolve their product suite with the addition of three new solutions:Contracts, Sign, and ActionGrid. All three are strong additions to the Conga suite, and all aim to more efficiently organize, simplify, and automate data document generation.

### Conga contracts:speed up the contract negotiation process

This might sound like a familiar scenario&mdash;You know that Salesforce helps to streamline daily activities and can increase your sales, but everything is getting bogged down in the contract management lifecycle. Your sales reps reach out to legal to make amendments or get approval but this process can be tedious and time consuming, especially when you are almost done. Conga Contracts can help.

Conga Contracts gives customers the ability to send a contract for negotiation, redline, and compare changes all within Salesforce. Solutions like Conga can help equip your team and speed up the contract negotiation process&mdash;resulting in more closed deals.

### ActionGrid: actionable views into Salesforce data

The Sales team reviews their forecasts at the end of each week to ensure that management is addressing every deal correctly. Sales operations must create a specific output at the end of each call, typically taking hours or even the entire weekend to verify the output is correct and formulated correctly.

With ActionGrid, sales operations can quickly change the data in their reports, including mass updates, multi filter, formulas, batch actions, and conditional formatting, even while on a call. Once the data is updated and paired with the power of Conga Composer, sales reps can export each report with thegit click of a button.
