Rackspace announces unlimited availability for the Fortinet速 FortiGate-VM in
Rackspace Openstack Public Cloud. By combining stateful inspection with a
comprehensive suite of robust security features, FortiGate Next-Generation
Firewall (NGFW) technology delivers complete content and network protection.

### Use cases

- **VPN Endpoint**: Fortinet's web-based GUI manager takes the complexity out
  of virtual private network (VPN) creation. Connect your office or datacenters
  to Rackspace Cloud using site-to-site VPN, or enable secure access from
  anywhere by using FortiClient client-to-site VPN. The FortiGate-VM supports
  the latest Internet Key Exchange (IKE), IPSEC, and Diffie-Hellman parameters.

- **NextGen Firewall**: Secure your cloud workloads with a firewall that can
  reduce the attack surface, improve regulatory compliance, and provide trusted
  application access. The FortiGate-VM delivers complete content and network
  protection by combining stateful inspection with a comprehensive suite of
  powerful security features.

- **Intrusion Prevention and Web Application Firewall**: Protect against current
  and emerging network-level threats. In addition to signature-based threat
  detection, an intrusion prevention system (IPS) performs anomaly-based
  detection, which alerts users to any traffic that matches attack behavior profiles.

- **Router**: The FortiGate-VM supports industry-standard routing protocols such
  as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and Routing
  Information Protocol (RIP).

### Simple, secure, powerful: Pick three

Whether you are an end-user connecting to a VPN on your smart phone, a network
administrator setting firewall policies, or a DevOps engineer planning to
provision secure environments quickly, the FortiGate-VM has you covered.

### Not just a firewall: A true UTM (Universal Threat Manager)

As cyberattacks grow increasingly sophisticated, it becomes more and more
evident that a traditional firewall cannot be a complete security solution.
Fortinet consolidates multiple security and networking functions into the
FortiGate-VM to protect your Rackspace cloud-hosted infrastructure. This
consolidation enables you to spend more time and resources on revenue growth
and profitability. At the same time, consolidation reduces the risks posed by
ransomware, phishing, and other evolving cybersecurity threats.

### Designed for a DevOps world

With innovative features such as cloud-init support, a RESTful API, and
FortiCloud, the FortiGate-VM integrates seamlessly into modern cloud
infrastructures. The FortiGate-VM is also available on all major cloud providers,
including Azure, AWS, GCP, and so on.
